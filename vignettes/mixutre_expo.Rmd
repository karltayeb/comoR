##  Mixture expo
Goal make a ebnm function for mixture of exponential using some of the script from ebnm
```{r cars}
set.seed(1)
n=1000
s <- rnorm(n, 1, 0.1)
x <- c(rexp(n / 2, rate = 0.1), rep(0, n / 2)) + rnorm(n, sd = s)

true_pi0 <- 0.5
scale <- 1:10
true_mode <- 0

true_g <- gammamix(pi = c(true_pi0,   rep(0.5/10,10)),
                   shape = c(1, rep(1,10)),
                   scale = c(0,  1:10),
                   shift = c(0, rep(0,10)))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
